						<div class="intro"><p>BY CHUCK GREEN I don't know about you but I 
love to see examples of how other designers work—they reveal better (or 
worse) ways of doing things and allow me to gauge whether my methods are
 mainstream or totally whacked-out. “If anyone finds out how I obsess 
about this stuff,” I tell myself, “they'll stick me in a home.”</p></div>
						<p>The problem is that step-by-step examples are rare. Why? Mainly
 because unless you are interested in sharing such information, there 
isn't much reason for recording it. And even if you are, detailing the 
steps can get in the way of the process. If I'm ready to move to the 
next stage of an idea, I am normally not interested in recording what 
I've done to get there.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_04.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_04.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p>The good news is I rarely let normal get in my way. What follows are 
some of the steps I took to create a recent logo. I saved some of the 
graphics I created along the way and have attempted to recall a little 
bit about what I was thinking. There is, of course, more to a logo 
design process than what you see here—this exercise includes little 
about the typical ramp up of preliminary discussions, research, and so 
on—space, time, and vanity limit me to showing just a portion of the 
process.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I start out on paper. I find it most 
productive to sketch out ideas in a notebook. A Moleskine notebook is my
 weapon of choice—its small and sturdy enough to carry in my back 
pocket. (I like them so much I sell the plain and horizontal-lined 
flavors in the ideabook.com store— found the graph version shown here a 
little noisy for me.)</p>

<p>I'm most concerned with concepts at this stage—not designs. To my way
 of thinking, designs emerge from concepts, concepts do not emerge from 
designs. My goal in creating a logo is, at best, to demonstrate the 
benefit of using the product or service and at minimum to create a 
visual symbol of the subject matter.</p>

<p>I often show my clients those rough ideas. I have found that getting 
feedback on basic concepts is best for everyone involved. It allows us 
to weed out ideas that look good to me but don't work for the client. It
 acknowledges that the client knows the subject best, no matter how much
 research I do. </p>

<p>What may appear to me to be a great solution to the problem sometimes
 just doesn't work for reasons I could not  be expected to know.</p>

<p>The logo I'll discuss here was designed for a helicopter transport 
company—Metro Aviation. I started by going through my sketches and 
choosing the concepts I thought had most merit.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 (below) &gt;</strong> I created some slightly tighter 
drawings of five of the ideas—the first, something to symbolize the 
basic rotor and lift dynamics.<br>
 <br>
</p><p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_07.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_07.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 2 &gt;</strong> Second is a helicopter with bird wings. 
Yes it's ugly (looks like a bat-copter)—but we're just exploring 
concepts, not designs.

</p><p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_08.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_08.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 3 &gt;</strong> Next, a more realistic rendition of a 
copter integrated with the type—perhaps a flyover where the aircraft 
casts a shadow in the letter form.

</p><p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_09.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_09.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 4 &gt;</strong> From the outset, the client expressed an
 interest in using a hummingbird as a symbol for the helicopter so I 
began to explore that idea as well.

</p><p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_10.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_10.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 5 &gt;</strong> The problem with the hummingbird was 
that, as I began doing research, I found lots of other helicopter 
companies were using something similar as their mark.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_11.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_11.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 6 &gt;</strong> That didn't rule it out, it just meant I
 would have develop the idea further to make it distinctive. To me, this
 version looks a bit more like its hovering.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_12.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_12.jpg" ;=""></p>
<p align="center"><a 
href="http://www.ideabook.com/indesign_templates_step_by_step.html"><img
 src="stepbystep_logo_files/chuck_green_indesign_ideabook.jpg" 
alt="Chuck Green adobe indesign ideabook templates"></a></p>

<p><br>
<strong>Step 7 &gt;</strong> But it was this design that made me think, 
“I'm onto something,”—the combination of the hummingbird, the implied 
motion of hovering, and the additional visual element of rotation added 
the extra something I was looking for. </p>

<p>My confidence was strengthened further when the client chose it from 
the lineup. </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_13.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_13.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 8 &gt;</strong> The rest, as they say, is history. The 
idea of the hovering bird stuck and I began to develop a design. First, I
 gathered together some photographs so that my actual design would 
reflect the correct proportions and positioning. </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_14.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_14.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 9 &gt;</strong> Research is crucial. If some aspect of 
your subject is inaccurate, you can waste amazing amounts of time 
pursuing a design your client will reject out of hand. In this case, you
 can see how different the beginning shape of the actual artwork (right)
 is from my original sketch (left).</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_15.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_15.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p>Step 10 &gt; The problem with logo design is you have to create 
finished art or something close to it to communicate your idea. I may 
tweak it after I get the client's okay, but I've got to be 95 percent 
finished with the art to sell it to the client. My software of choice is
 Adobe Illustrator. Here, I started by roughing out the body.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_16.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_16.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 11 &gt;</strong> I created the feathers using a series 
of ovals.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_17.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_17.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 12 &gt;</strong> Then I rotated the body and wing into 
hovering position.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_18.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_18.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 13 &gt;</strong> You have to mine a lot of rocks to find
 the gold. This is one of many ideas I experimented with in my attempt 
to show “rotation.” Really awful isn't it?</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_19.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_19.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 14 &gt;</strong> What seemed to work best was to use 
some type of oval to simulate the blur of the blades.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_20.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_20.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 15 &gt;</strong> Even better was a swirl. I took this 
clip art element...</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_21.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_21.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 16 &gt;</strong> and scaled it down vertically. Then I 
tilted the bird's body back to a vertical position so I was sure to get 
it centered correctly. What follows are variations of this basic design.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_22.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_22.jpg" ;=""></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.ideabook.com/tutorials/"><img 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/chuck_green_ideabook_graphic_design.jpg" 
alt="Chuck Green's free graphic design articles and tutorials from 
ideabook"></a></p>

<p><br>
<strong>Step 17 &gt;</strong> First, I added color and used the top of 
the swirl to define the division between the bird's body and its head. I
 also added a slight gap between the bottom of the swirl and the tail to
 accentuate the division between the swirl and the body. Finally, I 
added another oval below to act as a shadow.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_23.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_23.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 18 &gt;</strong> Dividing the swirl into two colors 
helped to further accentuate the swirling motion.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_24.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_24.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 19 &gt;</strong> I tried adding another shape as if the 
swirl were casting a shadow on the lower body. It works, but I thought 
it was getting a little too complex.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_25.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_25.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p>Step 20 &gt; And I tried changing the black swirl to gray.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_26.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_26.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 21&gt;</strong> This version includes a couple of light 
gray shapes I thought might give the image a little more of a sense of 
movement—nope.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_27.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_27.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 22 &gt;</strong> I finally settled on filling in the 
spaces between the bird's body and the swirl. My thinking was to 
simplify the final version as much as possible and, for me, removing the
 negative space helped.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_28.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_28.jpg" ;=""></p>
<p align="center"><a 
href="http://www.ideabook.com/indesign_templates_step_by_step.html"><img
 src="stepbystep_logo_files/chuck_green_indesign_ideabook.jpg" 
alt="Chuck Green adobe indesign ideabook templates"></a></p>

<p><br>
<strong>Step 23 &gt;</strong> I was actually really happy with this 
basic design. I even went so far as to work it into a business card 
layout using the colors the client requested.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_29.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_29.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 24 &gt;</strong> But here comes a reality check. The 
client decided the idea of hovering just wasn't convincing enough. He 
liked the design but thought the hovering motion would be more true to 
form if it was above the body as it would be on a helicopter.</p>

<p>Wow. Its always difficult to hear when a client isn't as excited 
about your solution as you are. But I can tell you the axiom “the 
customer is always right” is always true. At least if you want to stay 
in business. </p>

<p>I could spend the time necessary to provide the client with carefully
 considered, well-spoken reasons for going with what I created, but 
clients are no different than designers—if it doesn't work for you, it 
doesn't work for you—period.</p>

<p><strong>Step 25 &gt;</strong> So back to the drawing board. How do I 
glue these pieces together in a way that works?</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_31.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_31.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 26 &gt;</strong> First, I had to re-think the wings. The
 swirl took the place of the wings so I had to get them back in there.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_32.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_32.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 27 &gt;</strong> That worked for me, but the swirl 
didn't.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_33.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_33.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 28 &gt;</strong> I needed something simpler. A solid 
shape? Nope too massive.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_34.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_34.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 29 &gt;</strong> Again, I found simpler better. It 
worked for me and, more importantly, it was just what the client wanted.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_35.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_35.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 30 &gt;</strong> Next, I adjusted the colors to match 
the helicopter color scheme (blue and yellow) and added the shadow.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_36.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_36.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 31 &gt;</strong> The final hurdle was the tail. We tried
 several different versions. One...</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_37.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_37.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 32 &gt;</strong> Two...</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_38.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_38.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 33 &gt;</strong> Three...</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_39.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_39.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 34 &gt;</strong> and four...</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_40.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_40.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 35 &gt;</strong> I like it when clients push. Though I 
may cry and moan to myself at the time, more often than not, we end up 
with a better solution. That said, in this case, I personally prefer the
 interim solution, but then I'm not paying the bill. </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="ib_step_logo_41.jpg" 
src="stepbystep_logo_files/ib_step_logo_41.jpg" ;=""></p>

<p>Logo design is legalized gambling. When I take on a project I don't 
know if it will take eight hours or five days. In fact what I've shown 
you here is the tip of the iceberg. To the right, in PDF form, is a 
summary of some of the many iterations of the logo. </p>

<p>Though it is a challenge from all sides, there is nothing quite so 
exciting for a designer than discovering, developing, and implementing 
an image that becomes the visual representation of an entire 
organization. <br>
